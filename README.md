This is a Java application that manages a database of all the video games I've played. It provides functionalities to read data from a CSV file and create an SQLite database, or create one from scratch, as well as add, update, and delete entries from the database. These operations are performed through a command-line interface (an Android app may be developed at a later time along with support for other forms of media).

The application is built using Maven and uses the SQLite JDBC driver to interact with the database. Unit tests for the DatabaseManager class are included in the test folder.
